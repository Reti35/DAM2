I tried hard but where did we go wrong?
I hope we could... but I won't start all over again

Mid-day Street walks, lights fell and dispersed in the air
Nobody stopped to see them fade, your eyes seemed so innocent
Everything made sense to you, but they didn't to me

Deep inside my mind
I didn't compromise just for the love
Deep inside my mind
Believing your words

A way of life, a way of life
I heard you say "We were on the same street."
A way of life, a way of my life

Time

Old dry winds go by
Lone air comes quietly
Time
Old dry winds go by
Uncertain space you need to fill in

Every time goodbye to yesterday
Greeted by today
Smiling at tomorrow
No one really belongs
Each time we hope to stay around
I know how you feel
Beyond your words
